		    <h2>We value your trust</h2>
		  <p>The cornerstone of every relationship is built on trust. When you consider purchasing one of our vehicles and visit our web site to conduct your research, that to us, is the beginning of a relationship. We want you to feel comfortable while you're conducting that research. We want you to feel confident that the information we collect, and that you choose to share, will be treated with care. The first step in helping you to achieve that level of comfort and confidence is by explaining (in plain English) exactly what types of information we collect and why we collect it. It is our sincere hope that by being forthright in this communication of our Privacy Policy that the relationship we establish is a long-lasting one.</p>
		<h2>Our Pledge</h2>
		<ul>
		  <li>We will never share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties.
When we refer to non-affiliated third parties we mean organizations outside of Ford Motor Company with whom we do not have an association. For example, many of our promotions for sweepstakes and giveaways are made possible by marketing partnerships and alliances with companies whose customers have like interests as those customers who drive Ford vehicles. </li>
		  <li>Our partnerships with Harley-Davidson® and the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum are examples of "affiliated" third parties with whom we may share information, but only if we have your permission to do so, and only with that specific sponsor. Local Ford dealers are another example of "affiliated" third parties we may share your data with. </li>
		  <li>Finally, we may share your data with companies who provide data handling or other services to us, but such companies will be contractually bound not to use your information except for the purposes of our contract with them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Normal Web Site Usage</h2>
		<p>During a   normal visit to our site, no personally identifiable information about you is   collected. All information about our vehicles is free to browse at your leisure   without the need for you to provide us with any personal information. Your visit   does however generate a session log. </p>
		<h2>Session Logs: What they are and how we use   them.		  </h2>
		<p>When you visit any web site, the server housing the pages   automatically generates a &quot;session log.&quot; The logs are used by the owners of the   sites to track the pages you visit or request. The only data gathered is the   Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which by the way, contains   no personal information), the web site that referred you, the pages you visited   and the date and time of those visits. </p>
		<p>We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through   our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most   frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also   determine if the information we're providing is being used. </p>
		<h2>Cookies: What they are and how we use   them.		  </h2>
		<p>Another method of tracking web site visitors is through the   use of &quot;Cookies.&quot; Cookies are small bits of data that also help web site owners   and web servers identify you and remember you when you return. By doing this,   the web site owner and web server can provide you with information that is most   valuable to you, based on your last visit. </p>
		<p><strong>Important Cookie Facts: </strong></p>
		<ul>
          <li>Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make   while visiting a Web site, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site   cannot determine your name or e-mail address unless you choose to enter it into   a pre-existing input box. </li>
		  <li>Allowing a Web site to create a cookie does not give that site or   any other site access to the rest of your computer. </li>
		  <li>Cookies cannot roam around inside your computer and collect   personal information. </li>
		  <li>Only the site that created the cookie can read it. </li>
		  </ul>
		<p><strong>There are two types of cookies: </strong></p>
		<ul>
          <li>The first type, a session cookie, only stays in your computer   during the time you are logged into a particular site. When you leave the site,   the cookie automatically deletes itself. </li>
		  <li>The other type, called a persistent cookie, can have an   indefinite shelf life or have a predetermined expiration date built in. These   types of cookies are primarily used to remember you for a specified period of   time. For instance, if you sign up for membership in a club, or enter a   sweepstakes that requires you to participate over a length of time, persistent   cookies are used to remember you. Another example is with web sites that offer   the ability to personalize the way the page is displayed. </li>
		  </ul>
		<p><strong>Ford Division Cookie Examples:</strong><br />
		  Password Protected Areas:</p>
		<ul>
          <li>In the Ford Division web site, we use both types of cookies. For   instance, if an area of our site is password protected, and you select a check   box asking us to &quot;remember&quot; your password, that information is stored in cookie   form on your hard drive. If you don't select the checkbox no cookie is created   and you would have to log in to the password protected area the next time you   visited. So in this case, cookies help us serve information to you faster. </li>
		  </ul>
		<h2>How to Prevent Cookies		  </h2>
		<p>If you are   concerned about being identified or about having your web browsing traced   through the use of a cookie, you can prevent them from being deposited in your   computer. You can also set your browser to warn you whenever a cookie is being   deposited. </p>
		<p>Remember though that the majority of web sites use cookies and   that blocking all cookies will prevent some online services from working. An   e-commerce or shopping site, for example, likely uses cookies in their shopping   process. Also, setting your browser to warn you can also become quite annoying. </p>
		<p>We use third-party advertising technology to serve ads when you   visit sites upon which we advertise. This technology uses information about your   visits to this Web site and the sites upon which we advertise, (not including   your name, address, or other personal information), to serve our ads to you. In   the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may   be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons,   provided by our ad serving partner, to help manage our online advertising. These   web beacons enable our ad server to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser   visits this site and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Web site. The   information we collect and share through this technology is not personally   identifiable. To learn more about our third party ad serving partner, cookies,   and how to &quot;opt-out&quot; of the ad serving cookie, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="This link will open a new browser window">click here.</a> </p>
		<h2>Detecting Your System's Performance Level		  </h2>
		<p>Sometimes, prior to serving a web page, a web server will use   a simple html program to check the speed of your Internet connection or the   existence of certain plug-ins or software. An example would be to detect which   version of a particular browser you are using or which version of the Macromedia   Flash plug-in you have. Once identified, the server delivers the page or Flash   movie to match the performance level or version of the software or plug-in in   your system. The benefit is that you always see the content in its optimum   state. </p>
		<p>Not all web site owners do this simply because it means having to   build multiple versions of content. In fact, most simply offer a statement on   their homepage to the effect that &quot;This site is best viewed using Microsoft IE   4.0 and/or Netscape 4.0 etc.&quot; </p>
		<p>In the fordvehicles.com web site, we sometimes check your Internet   connection speed in order to deliver multi-media content such as streaming video   or audio at its optimum viewing level. </p>
		<h2>Personal Information: What it is and how we use it.		  </h2>
		<p>Before we get into how and why we gather information about   you, be assured of two things: One, we will never share your personal   information with any non-affiliated third party (Please see earlier explanation   of &quot;non-affiliated&quot;.). And Two, we will never send you unsolicited e-mail based   on your interaction with this site. Of course you may have provided your e-mail   address to Ford in some other situation in which case you may receive e-mail   stemming with that interaction. </p>
		<p>Personal information such as name, mailing address, e-mail   address, and in some cases your phone number is collected to respond to your   requests for future contact. There are obvious areas within our site where   collecting personal information is unavoidable. For instance, when you request a   brochure or enter a contest. Some of the information we ask for is mandatory and   required to fulfill the request. Other information we ask for is optional and we   use that to help us better understand you and better define how we market and   sell our vehicles or design our communications. </p>
		<p>Required information is always indicated by an asterisk next to   the input box. </p>
		<h2>Secure Socket Layers (SSL): What it is and how we use them.		  </h2>
		<p>Reputable sites that collect sensitive personal   information, such as credit card numbers that you use for purchasing products   and services over the internet pass your information through what is called   &quot;Secure Socket Layers&quot; or SSL. This is encryption technology that helps   safeguard your personal information against misuse by unauthorized individuals. </p>
		<p>All information we collect from you that contains personally   identifiable information is passed through SSL. </p>
		<h2>Protecting Your Children's Privacy		  </h2>
		<p>We will never knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of   age. If we discover that any personally identifiable information collected is   from a person under 13 years of age, that information will be deleted from our   database. More information can be found online at the FTC's <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm" onclick="window.open(this.href); return false;" title="This link will open a new browser window">Children's Privacy Web site</a>. </p>
		<h2>Outside Links: What they are and how we use them.		  </h2>
		<p>An outside link refers to any link that takes you to a site   not controlled by Ford Division. Many of our contests and sweepstakes are   conducted in conjunction with media partners such as magazine publishers. Many   times as part of the promotional agreement, we provide links to that partner's   Web site. </p>
		<p>If you have a concern about that Web site's practices, you should   carefully read their Privacy Policy before submitting any personal information. </p>
		<h2>Downloadable files: What they are and how we use them.		  </h2>
		<p>Downloading files refers to the act of choosing to receive   a file or program from a web site. Examples are a web browser, a sound file,   movie file or screensaver. Downloadable files are usually executables. Meaning   that once they are downloaded, clicking on them launches or installs a program   or deposits files on your computer. Whenever you download a file from a web   site, you will always be given the choice of where you would like to save the   file. Unless you explicitly trust the site delivering the downloadable, it is a   good idea to save the file to disk before opening or activating it. </p>
		<p>We use downloadable files to deliver things like screensavers,   wallpaper and electronic brochures. If information on our site requires a   particular piece of software to view it, we will provide a link for you to   acquire that software. Examples are plug-ins for your browser that allow you to   view files like Macromedia Flash or Shockwave, Adobe Acrobat, the Quick Time   player or Real Player. We rarely, if ever, will require you to download an   uncommon piece of software or program to view our information. </p>
		<h2>Requests from Law Enforcement Agencies		  </h2>
		<p>Ford Division reserves the right to share information collected from our web   site with law enforcement agencies who are in the process of conducting lawful   investigations. </p>
		<h2>Scope of Content:		  </h2>
		<p>The Ford Division   Web site (www.fordvehicles.com), contains information that is intended solely   for the United States. The Ford Division products and promotional programs   mentioned in our Web site are subject to availability in your area. Any prices   given as Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (&quot;MSRP&quot;) are in U.S. dollars and   do not include extra costs such as title, taxes or registration. When you build   and price a vehicle you may be shown invoice and the Ford Direct Price. Total   Invoice is the amount that Ford Motor Company charges its dealer for a vehicle.   Total Invoice may not represent the actual dealer cost, as there are holdbacks,   floor plan financing, assistance, dealer advertising fund fees, shipping, and   charges for gasoline that may be included in the total invoice. The Ford Direct   Price includes the base price for the selected vehicle, factory options, and   destination charges. The Ford Direct Price does not include tax, title, and   license fees established at the federal, state, and local levels. In addition,   the Ford Direct Price does not include dealer documentation fees charged to the   consumer, or items that may have been added while the vehicle is in inventory. </p>
